# 🛍️ UKG Marketplace

**Missing the centralized marketplace chat from Slack? We've got you covered!**

## 👋 Ah, Remember When...

Remember when finding that standing desk, selling your old monitor, or swapping office supplies was as easy as posting in the Slack marketplace channel? Those were the days! Since we've moved away from that centralized hub, things just haven't been the same.

**That's why we built UKG Marketplace** - a simple, company-wide solution to bring back the convenience of having one place to buy, sell, and trade items with colleagues!

## ✨ Features That'll Make Your Life Easier

### 🛒 Easy Buy & Sell Experience
- **Simple Item Listings** - Post items you want to sell or trade
- **Company-wide Access** - Connect with colleagues across departments
- **Search & Filter** - Find exactly what you need without hassle
- **Item Categories** - Browse by item types and more

### 🚀 Streamlined Marketplace Functions
- **Basic Listings** - Add descriptions and details about your items
- **Item Status** - See what's available and what's been sold
- **Contact Info** - Connect with sellers directly
- **Clean Interface** - No complicated bells and whistles - just what you need

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation lives in the `/docs` directory:
- **Go Style Guide** (`go-style-guide.md`) - Coding standards for contributors
- Additional documentation will be added as the project evolves
